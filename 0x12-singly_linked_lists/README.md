## Linked lists
### Singly linked lists
Use cases:
1. It is used to implement stacks and queues which are like fundamental needs throughout computer science.
2. To prevent the collision between the data in the hash map, we use a singly linked list.
3. If we ever noticed the functioning of a casual notepad, it also uses a singly linked list to perform undo or redo or deleting functions.
4. We can think of its use in a photo viewer for having look at photos continuously in a slide show.
5. In the system of train, the idea is like a singly linked list, as if 	you want to add a Boggie, either you have to take a new boggie to add at last or you must spot a place in between boggies and add it.
